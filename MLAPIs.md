## Vertex AI - Googleâ€™s comprehensive AI platform
* Contains ML tools needed to create, train, manage and deploy machine learning models
* Includes tools for data scientists such as
  * Managed JupyterLab notebooks
  * Integration with widely used open source frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
* Also includes tools for non-data scientists
  * Contains pre-trained APIs for vision, video, natural language, and more
  * Customer can add their own data to the models for further customization

## BigQuery ML

Without needing to move your data out of BigQuery, with BigQuery ML, you can train and deploy machine learning models directly using SQL. That means you've got data
storage, data analytics, and machine learning all within BigQuery.
* Train and deploy ML models in SQL
* Execute ML workflows without moving data from BigQuery
* Automate common ML tasks
* Built-in infrastructure management, security & compliance
